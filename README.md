# Goals

The main objective of this application is to control the lights of my apartment through an angular UI.

# FEATURES
* Select a light
* - change it's color, brightness, saturation.
* - allow transition time changes

*** "MOOD SETTINGS" ***

1. "Theater" - lights go mid red and slowly dim over the first 5 minutes to a low white
2. "Netflix and Chill" - Starts lit up white, blends into pink and dims to 10% over the course of ten minutes
3. "Movie is over" - lights get brighter over 2 minutes to allow stretching - increments each few seconds insteads of smoothly

# EUROTRASH EXAMPLE
